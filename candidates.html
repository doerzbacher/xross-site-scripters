                    <h3>John Jacobs</h3>
                    <p>This guy is a really great guy.  Sometimes he slips up and does something that isn't great, but hey, that's life.  At least we are being honest about it and letting you know straight up that he isn't perfect.  His platform doesn't really reflect what he believes, but rather what he believes has the best chance of getting him elected.  His name is alliterative, how much better can this guy get?  If you still have not decided to vote for John Jacobs, just remember that we have access to records and we can find where you live.</p>

                    <h3>Mike Fallopian</h3>
                    <p>Mike Fallopian has morals and ethics, but you're not here to read about that.  You're here to see us demean our opponent until you realize the only proper choice is Mike Fallopian.  Mike is a Historical Mail Major and is enthralled by the history of the US post office.  He believes that the mail system is a hidden operation used by the government to spy on the citizens of this great country.  Winning this position will look good for Mike in the future when he decides to run for a government office in order to get closer to the truth of this conspiracy.

                    <h3>Alien Man</h3>
                    <p>Alien Man doesn't like humans.  Alien Man is also a pacifist.  He will just sit back and grumble at the thought of being around so many people if he is elected.  Alien Man doesn't know why is here or how he got here in the first place.  Alien Man just wants to live a peaceful life on a farm away from the troubles of the city.  Is that too much for an extra-terrestrial being to ask?  I think not.
